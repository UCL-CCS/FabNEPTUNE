# Run Ensemble Examples

### Convection2D_ensemble

These examples assume that you have been able to run the basic FabSim examples described in the other documentation files, and that you have built and configured Nektar++ (https://www.nektar.info/) on the target machine.

To run type:
```
fabsim localhost Convection2D_ensemble_local:Convection2D_ensemble_example
```
This example runs 3 simulations with different input files, which vary the simulation timestep, using the same topology file.


### Convection3D_ensemble

This example runs 3 simulations with different input files, which vary the simulation timestep, using the same topology file.

To run type:
```
fabsim localhost  Convection3D_ensemble_local:Convection3D_ensemble_example
```
